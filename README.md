# No Whey - Milestone Project One

## Project Description
This project has been created for a fictional powerlifting gym, No Whey. Located in Cardiff, the gym caters to a niche of vegan and plant based lifters as more athletes turn to this diet for ethical and performance related reasons.

## User Experience

### Strategy
In creating this website, I am looking to cater to both business goals and the needs of users.

The gym owners are looking to promote the gym's mission statement and increase membership sign ups. This brings in revenue to the gym, allowing it to grow as a business. Also, as the gym has ethical motivations alongside financial ones, this should be empahsised in balance too.

Potential gym goers are looking for information related to the gym including it's facilities and classes, as well as it's location, contact information and upcoming events. Therefore, the website should make this vital information clear, succint and accessible to end-users. 

### Scope

Based on the conclusions drawn in the strategy plane, the most important features for the website were undoubtedly information about the gym and it's classes. This includes the time and dates, as well as the location and contacts for requesting further information. The gym is effectively the product in this context, and therefore this allows users to know how to access the product.

Also, an online sign-up form allows the user to sign-up quick and easily, plus it increases the likelihood of new gym users as the process is readily available on the website they're using. This will benefit the gym owners as it promotes conversion.

### Structure

The home page will hold the vital information of location, contact information and mission statement. As the times and dates of the events are necessarily linked to the location, it makes sense for these features to be placed together, alongside the suggested map. Combining these features with contact information also allows for queries around dates and location to be clarified.

As there is a lot of information to include on classes such as titles, descriptions, dates and times, these will require an entire page dedicated to them. The sign up form will also be located on it's own page to keep the site visually simple and organised. Throughtout the classes page, the sign up form will be linked to encourage its use.

As the website will only feature a relatively small number of static pages, I opted not to create a flowchart. However, I made sure to have a clear idea of how users would move through the website. The home page acts as the landing page, and therefore will feature the prioritised location and contact information. It will also feature information on the gym's mission statement, to engage users and make clear the product's niche. The 

### Skeleton

As assessed in the structure stage, the site will be separated into three pages, attributing different priority levels to the information. The home page, as the landing page, will feature the highest priority information as established in previous planes: event dates and times, location and contact details, alongside the map for visual interest and practical use. Also, as the landing page, the front of the homepage will invite users to sign-up to newsletter. This will be repeated on the classes page to further the gym owners motivation of increasing members.

The classes page will be located next, as this is the second most important information when end-users assess the gym. The sign up page is located last in the navigation hierarchy, as once the information from the home page and classes page has been consumed, this would be the logcial time to consider signing up. However, this important page will also be accessible through a single click as the navigation bar at the top of the screen will remain consistent throughout.


### Surface

Visually, the finished product seeks to produce a clean and aesthetically pleasing interface. This is achieved through intentionally chosen images contrasted against a predominantly light coloured background. A consistent and simple colour palette is utilised, as attached below. The palette utilises gender neutral, muted tones derived from the home page's hero image that are consistent throughout each page. If future pages were to be added, they would also follow this palette for consistency and branding purposes.

Images will be integrated into each page, catering to the visual and aesthetic-oriented end-user, without taking away from the vital information contained in the text.
